# Array manipulations and sum
Given an array of N integers and an integer M.

Find an element K in the array such that if all the elements from the array that are greater than K are made equal to K then the sum of all the elements of the resultant array becomes equal to M.

If it is not possible to find such an element then display -1.

 

## Input:
```yaml
    5

    12 3 6 7 8

    15
```

    

### Where:

- First line represents the number of elements in the array.
- Second line represents the elements in the array.
- Third line represents the value of M.
 

## Output:
```yaml
    3
```
 

### Explanation:
- Resultant array = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3}, Sum of the array elements = 15 = M, hence the output 3.
