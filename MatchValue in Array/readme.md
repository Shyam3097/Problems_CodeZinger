# Find if the array has an element whose value is half of the sum of array
Given a sorted array (with unique elements)
Find whether there exists an element(say X) which is exactly half of the sum of all the elements of the array including X.

 

## Input:
```yaml
    3

    1 2 3
```
    

### Where:

- First line represents the number of elements in the array.
- Second line represents the elements in the array.
 

## Output:
```yaml
    Yes
```
    

### Explanation:

- Sum of all the elements of the array is 1+2+3 = 6.
- For element 3, 3*2=6, hence the output "Yes".
